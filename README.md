# Dev Containers

Superset of containers for code, but adds in specific configs for the environment that you are working with your code. IDE, settings, variable. 

Based on open source project, containers.dev

https://containers.dev/

Can be used in 
- Local editors with Docker
Codespaces
or cloud hosting services

what is a devcontainer? literally a devcontainer.json
- Pointer file (json file) that points to a docker image

You can select the settings, extensions, configs, and edtor options

SOME TRADE OFFS
- can be kind of slow

How to start up (very simple tbh)
- Add the docker file, or the docker compose file

Some issues that dev containers can address
- Use a devcontainer json file, and have the user reporudce the issue by running the dev container.

"I'll send you a link to a devcontainer"
- can literally use this for teaching or helping users get setup quickly 

Can use prebuilds to spin up codespaces faster, and plus you can use Liveshare. https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share
